This is my initial prompt at the start of this project.
write me the code on the site them I will create them manaully, 
instead of deleting the code write it here and give write it a manual 
with steps to follow and how do I link the pages, html, css and javascrip, 
I have attached an image showing my design with 4 screenshot designs of the app am developing,
start from index.html, css and javascript for the landing, javascript should be used to the buttons 
to click and navigate to the next pages, then do the same for client , provider and login pages , 
include all the good practises that the app like waasha needs to have, and explain all steps cleary 
to me as a student and someone who is self teaching himself progaming or web development. this i should be 
able to use as my documentation in the futurer, also add what i might have left out, I hav more design of the 
app, I will provide them as we go along, I shold be confortable with these 3 progaming languages by the time I 
finish develoing this app, html, css and javascrip and good proctsise or coding such as clean code ect.
